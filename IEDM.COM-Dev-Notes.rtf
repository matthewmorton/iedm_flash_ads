\f0\fs26 \cf2 So if you guys can do $50 an hour, I'll make that work (I typically do $100/hr for large scale web work) but this is fast turnaround content generation. I also work really quickly, so you'll save $ there. The link I shared has 4 hours of work (for all sizes and creative), the first 300x250 was 1.5 hours, so only $75 for that animated standard flash unit. The backup static would be an output of the final frame, and that's included (for mobile). I've already created a google doc for the project, moving forward I would create a sprint tracker (spreadsheet) with start and end dates, concept name i.e. "Bacon Cat Tank" and hours that I spend - that way you can track my time / edit via a centralized document. My business model is pretty cool for this kind of work - I'll only charge for the units and ads you decide to use. Turnaround time is usually 24-48 hours depending on the number of ads and resizes. We could also cut hours I spend by sending art or images you have... if you noticed I retouched the Bacon Cat Tank image along the shoulders to lighten the back of the shirt and added a shadow around the neck so it's a little easier to identify.\
Also included after the creative is final output of flash compatibility. If you guys are using an ad serving platform, I'll add the API clicktags specific to your publishers (only applicable to flash - statics are always quick and ready to go). I'd say you guys should handle the quality control and proofreading on your end, just to save unnecessary time. \
